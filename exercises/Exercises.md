# Introduction

**1)** Replace only the first occurrence of `5` with `five` for the given stdin source.

```bash
$ echo 'They ate 5 apples and 5 mangoes' | sed ##### add your solution here
They ate five apples and 5 mangoes
```

**2)** Replace all occurrences of `5` with `five`.

```bash
$ echo 'They ate 5 apples and 5 mangoes' | sed ##### add your solution here
They ate five apples and five mangoes
```

**3)** Replace all occurrences of `0xA0` with `0x50` and `0xFF` with `0x7F` for the given input file.

```bash
$ cat hex.txt
start address: 0xA0, func1 address: 0xA0
end address: 0xFF, func2 address: 0xB0

$ sed ##### add your solution here
start address: 0x50, func1 address: 0x50
end address: 0x7F, func2 address: 0xB0
```

**4)** The substitute command searches and replaces sequences of characters. When you need to map one or more characters with another set of corresponding characters, you can use the `y` command. Quoting from the manual:

>**y/src/dst/** Transliterate any characters in the pattern space which match any of the source-chars with the corresponding character in dest-chars.

Use the `y` command to transform the given input string to get the output string as shown below.

```bash
$ echo 'goal new user sit eat dinner' | sed ##### add your solution here
gOAl nEw UsEr sIt EAt dInnEr
```

**5)** Why does the following command produce an error? How'd you fix it?

```bash
$ echo 'a sunny day' | sed s/sunny day/cloudy day/
sed: -e expression #1, char 7: unterminated `s' command

# expected output
$ echo 'a sunny day' | sed ##### add your solution here
a cloudy day
```

# In-place file editing

**1)** For the input file `text.txt`, replace all occurrences of `in` with `an` and write back the changes to `text.txt` itself. The original contents should get saved to `text.txt.orig`

```bash
$ cat text.txt
can ran want plant
tin fin fit mine line
$ sed ##### add your solution here

$ cat text.txt
can ran want plant
tan fan fit mane lane
$ cat text.txt.orig
can ran want plant
tin fin fit mine line
```

**2)** For the input file `text.txt`, replace all occurrences of `an` with `in` and write back the changes to `text.txt` itself. Do not create backups for this exercise. Note that you should have solved the previous exercise before starting this one.

```bash
$ cat text.txt
can ran want plant
tan fan fit mane lane
$ sed ##### add your solution here

$ cat text.txt
cin rin wint plint
tin fin fit mine line
$ diff text.txt text.txt.orig
1c1
< cin rin wint plint
---
> can ran want plant
```

**3)** For the input file `copyright.txt`, replace `copyright: 2018` with `copyright: 2019` and write back the changes to `copyright.txt` itself. The original contents should get saved to `2018_copyright.txt.bkp`

```bash
$ cat copyright.txt
bla bla 2015 bla
blah 2018 blah
bla bla bla
copyright: 2018
$ sed ##### add your solution here

$ cat copyright.txt
bla bla 2015 bla
blah 2018 blah
bla bla bla
copyright: 2019
$ cat 2018_copyright.txt.bkp
bla bla 2015 bla
blah 2018 blah
bla bla bla
copyright: 2018
```

**4)** In the code sample shown below, two files are created by redirecting the output of the `echo` command. Then a `sed` command is used to edit `b1.txt` in-place as well as create a backup named `bkp.b1.txt`. Will the `sed` command work as expected? If not, why?

```bash
$ echo '2 apples' > b1.txt
$ echo '5 bananas' > -ibkp.txt
$ sed -ibkp.* 's/2/two/' b1.txt
```

**5)** For the input file `pets.txt`, remove the first occurrence of `I like ` from each line and write back the changes to `pets.txt` itself. The original contents should get saved with the same filename inside the `bkp` directory. Assume that you do not know whether `bkp` exists or not in the current working directory.

```bash
$ cat pets.txt
I like cats
I like parrots
I like dogs

##### add your solution here

$ cat pets.txt
cats
parrots
dogs
$ cat bkp/pets.txt
I like cats
I like parrots
I like dogs
```

**25)** What characters can be used as REGEXP delimiters?

<br>

# Flags

**1)** For the input file `para.txt`, remove all groups of lines marked with a line beginning with `start` and a line ending with `end`. Match both these markers case insensitively.

```bash
$ cat para.txt
good start
Start working on that
project you always wanted
to, do not let it end
hi there
start and try to
finish the End
bye

$ sed ##### add your solution here
good start
hi there
bye
```

**2)** The `headers.txt` file contains one header per line, starting with one or more `#` characters followed by one or more whitespace characters and then some words. Convert such lines to the corresponding output as shown below.

```bash
$ cat headers.txt
# Regular Expressions
## Subexpression calls
## The dot meta character

$ sed ##### add your solution here
regular-expressions
subexpression-calls
the-dot-meta-character
```

**3)** Using `para.txt`, create a file named `five.txt` with lines that contain a whole word of length **5** and a file named `seven.txt` with lines that contain a whole word of length **7**.

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here

$ cat five.txt
good start
Start working on that
hi there
start and try to

$ cat seven.txt
Start working on that
project you always wanted
```

**4)** Given sample strings have fields separated by `,` where field values can be empty as well. Use `sed` to replace the third field with `42`.

```bash
$ echo 'lion,,ant,road,neon' | sed ##### add your solution here
lion,,42,road,neon

$ echo ',,,' | sed ##### add your solution here
,,42,
```

**5)** Replace all occurrences of `e` with `3` except the first two matches.

$ echo 'sample item teem eel' | sed ##### add your solution here
sample item t33m 33l
```

**6)** For the input file `addr.txt`, replace all input lines with the number of characters in those lines. `wc -L` is one of the ways to get the length of a line as shown below. Assume that the input file doesn't have single or double quote characters.

```bash
# note that newline character isn't counted, which is preferable here
$ echo "Hello World" | wc -L
11

$ sed ##### add your solution here
11
11
17
14
5
13
```

**7)** For the input file `para.txt`, assume that it'll always have lines in multiples of 4. Use `sed` commands such that there are 4 lines at a time in the pattern space. Then, delete from `start` till `end` provided `start` is matched only at the start of a line. Also, match these two keywords case insensitively.

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here
good start

hi there

bye
```

**8)** For the input file `patterns.txt`, filter lines containing three or more occurrences of `ar`. For such lines, replace the third from last occurrence of `ar` with `X`.

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here
par car tX far Cart
pXt cart mart
```

**9)** Display lines from `sample.txt` that satisfy both of these conditions:

* `he` matched irrespective of case
* either `World` or `Hi` matched case sensitively

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here
Hello World
Hi there
```

**10)** For the input file `patterns.txt`, surround all hexadecimal sequences with a minimum of four characters with `[]`. Match `0x` as an optional prefix, but shouldn't be counted for determining the length. Match the characters case insensitively, and the sequences shouldn't be surrounded by other word characters. Display only the modified lines.

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here
"should not match [0XdeadBEEF]"
Hi42Bye nice1423 [bad42]
took 0xbad 22 [0x0ff1ce]
eqn2 = pressure*3+42/5-[14256]
```

<br>

# Shell substitutions

**1)** Replace `#expr#` with the value of the `usr_ip` shell variable. Assume that this variable can only contain the metacharacters as shown in the sample below.

```bash
$ usr_ip='c = (a/b) && (x-5)'
$ mod_ip=$(echo "$usr_ip" | sed ##### add your solution here)
$ echo 'Expression: #expr#' | sed ##### add your solution here
Expression: c = (a/b) && (x-5)
```

**2)** Repeat the previous exercise, but this time with command substitution instead of using a temporary variable.

```bash
$ usr_ip='c = (a/b/y) && (x-5)'
$ echo 'Expression: #expr#' | sed ##### add your solution here
Expression: c = (a/b/y) && (x-5)
```

<br>

# z, s and f command line options

**1)** Replace any character other than word and `.` characters with the `_` character for the sample filenames shown below.

```bash
$ mkdir test_dir && cd $_
$ touch 'file with spaces.txt' $'weird$ch\nars.txt' '!f@oo.txt'
# > at start of line indicates continuation of multiline shell command
$ for file in *; do
>   new_name=$(printf '%s' "$file" | sed ##### add your solution here)
>   mv "$file" "$new_name"
> done

$ ls
file_with_spaces.txt  _f_oo.txt  weird_ch_ars.txt
$ cd .. && rm -r test_dir
```

**2)** Print only the third line, if any, from these input files: `addr.txt`, `para.txt` and `copyright.txt`

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here
This game is good
project you always wanted
bla bla bla
```

**3)** For the input file `hex.txt`, use content from `replace.txt` to perform search and replace operations. Each line in `replace.txt` starts with the search term, followed by a space and then followed by the replace term. Assume that these terms do not contain any `sed` metacharacters.

```bash
$ cat hex.txt
start address: 0xA0, func1 address: 0xA0
end address: 0xFF, func2 address: 0xB0
$ cat replace.txt
0xA0 0x5000
0xB0 0x6000
0xFF 0x7000

##### add your solution here
start address: 0x5000, func1 address: 0x5000
end address: 0x7000, func2 address: 0x6000
```

**4)** For the input file `nul_separated`, use the ASCII NUL character as the *line* separator and display lines containing `fig`. Also, change NUL characters in the output to the newline character.

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here
apple
fig
mango
icecream
```

**5)** For the input file `addr.txt`, change a newline character that comes before an uppercase letter to `.` followed by a space character. Assume that the input file doesn't have ASCII NUL characters.

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here
Hello World. How are you. This game is good. Today is sunny
12345. You are funny

**4)** Convert the contents of `headers.txt` such that it matches the content of `anchors.txt`. The input file `headers.txt` contains one header per line, starting with one or more `#` characters followed by a space character and then followed by the heading. You have to convert such headings into anchor tags as shown by the contents of `anchors.txt`. Save the output in `out.txt`.

```bash
$ cat headers.txt
# Regular Expressions
## Subexpression calls
## The dot meta character
$ cat anchors.txt
# <a name="regular-expressions"></a>Regular Expressions
## <a name="subexpression-calls"></a>Subexpression calls
## <a name="the-dot-meta-character"></a>The dot meta character

$ diff -s out.txt anchors.txt
Files out.txt and anchors.txt are identical
```

**5)** What is the difference between `t` and `T` commands?

**6)** The `blocks.txt` file uses `%=%=` to separate group of lines. Display the first such group.

```bash
$ cat blocks.txt
%=%=
apple
banana
%=%=
3.14
42
1000
%=%=
brown
green
%=%=
hi
hello there
bye

%=%=
apple
banana
```

# Processing lines bounded by distinct markers

**1)** The `blocks.txt` file uses `%=%=` to separate group of lines. Display the last such group.

```bash
##### add your solution here
%=%=
hi
hello there
bye
```

**2)** The `code.txt` file has code snippets that are surrounded by whole lines containing `%%Code: python%%` and `%%end%%`. The end of such snippets is always followed by an empty line. Assume that there will always be at least one line of code between the markers. Delete all such code snippets as well as the empty line that follows.

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here
H1: Introduction

REPL is a good way to learn Python for beginners.

H2: String methods

Python comes loaded with awesome methods.
Enjoy learning Python.

```

**3)** The `code.txt` file has code snippets that are surrounded by whole lines containing `%%Code: python%%` and `%%end%%`. Display the lines between such markers only for the first block.

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here
>>> 3 + 7
10
>>> 22 / 7
3.142857142857143
>>> 22 // 7
3
```

**4)** The input file `broken.txt` starts with a line containing `top` followed by some content before a line containing `bottom` is found. Blocks of lines bounded by these two markers repeats except for the last block as it is missing the `bottom` marker. The first `sed` command shown below doesn't work because it is matching till the end of file due to the missing marker. Correct this command to get the expected output shown below.

```bash
$ cat broken.txt
--top--
3.14
[bottom]
--top--
1234567890
[bottom]
--top--
Hi there
Have a nice day
Good bye

# wrong output
$ sed -n '/top/,/bottom/ {//!p}' broken.txt
3.14
1234567890
Hi there
Have a nice day
Good bye

# expected output
##### add your solution here
3.14
1234567890
```

**5)** For the input file `addr.txt`, replace the lines occurring between the markers `How` and `12345` with the contents of the file `hex.txt`.

```bash
$ sed ##### add your solution here
Hello World
How are you
start address: 0xA0, func1 address: 0xA0
end address: 0xFF, func2 address: 0xB0
12345
You are funny
```
